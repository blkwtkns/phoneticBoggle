# Phonetic Boggle!
Aiming to make a fun phonetic twist on tradition Boggle game

# Features to add
  * 'Enter' keypress enables submission, would speed up the game considerably
  * Definitely needs some styling work
  * Player name input, so that high scores can be more accurate
  * Maybe hold high scores on server, so that high score data can persist
  * Scoring based on word length
  * Give optionality to populate board with phonetic characters, turning the game into a word buiilding sprint with only phonemes
  * Extra difficult mode, 'phonetic' mode, only letting player use full phonetically realized characters
  * Two player mode!

# Bugs
  * I think the timer is off, it feels slow
  * Dictionary API, pearson, has 'interesting' results, and doesn't seem to return a predictable object, so sometimes the phonemic returns are just flat wrong. Would probably be best to build internal phonemic dictionary.
